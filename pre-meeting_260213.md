# Pre-Meeting Note (260213)

1. Region: Lubelskie vs Silesia / Śląskie (PL22)

| Item | Lubelskie (PL81) | Silesia / Śląskie (PL22) |
|---|---|---|
| Regional profile | Larger rural/peripheral profile; productivity/accessibility constraints | Core heavy-industry and mining transition area; stronger urban-industrial base |
| Core problem | Low income, outmigration, structural lag | Employment and social shock from decarbonisation transition |
| Climate-neutrality narrative | Agriculture/buildings/SME decarbonisation focus | Coal and heavy-industry restructuring focus (high policy impact) |
| ERDF fit | Very strong (infrastructure, innovation, SME support) | Very strong (industrial transition, innovation, urban regeneration) |
| JTF fit | Weak or uncertain under current territorial setup | Strong (representative JTF transition territory) |
| Persuasiveness for 5-minute briefing | Solid but harder to justify "why JTF" | Strong message line: problem-fund-solution is direct |
| Assignment risk (ERDF+JTF mandatory) | Higher risk | Lower risk |

Note: `PL81` and `PL22` are NUTS2 regional statistical codes.

2. ERDF/JTF

| Item | ERDF | JTF |
|---|---|---|
| Official name | European Regional Development Fund | Just Transition Fund |
| Nature | EU cohesion policy fund (shared management) | EU cohesion policy fund targeted to transition impacts (shared management) |
| Institutional owner | European Commission + Member State/Regional Managing Authorities | European Commission + Member State/Regional Managing Authorities |
| Resource base | EU budget allocations within approved programmes | EU budget allocations dedicated to just transition territories |
| Support structure | Programmes and calls set by approved priorities; beneficiaries apply to managing authorities | Requires approved territorial just transition framework and programme priorities; beneficiaries apply via calls |
| Objective | Reduce regional disparities, boost productivity/innovation, support sustainable territorial development | Mitigate social and economic costs of climate transition in most affected territories |
| Typical beneficiaries | Local/regional authorities, public bodies, SMEs, research/innovation actors, utilities (depending on call) | Workers and communities affected by transition, local authorities, SMEs, training institutions (depending on call) |
| Project scale | From small local projects to large infrastructure/investment packages | Typically transition-focused packages and measures linked to affected territories |
| Poland support scale logic | Poland receives predefined programme envelopes; projects compete within programme-call budgets | Poland has a predefined JTF envelope; only approved transition territories/programmes can use it |
| Practical implication for regions | Regions do not freely pull money from a national residual pool; they apply under open calls in approved programmes | Same rule, but with tighter territorial and eligibility constraints |

Short interpretation:
- National envelopes are set first by EU legal/programming decisions.
- Regional project selection happens later through programme calls.
- So "remaining national money" does not mean automatic access for any region outside approved scope.
