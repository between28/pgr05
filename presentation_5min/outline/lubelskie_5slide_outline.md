# Lubelskie 5-Slide Outline

## Slide 1. Why Lubelskie Now
- Lubelskie (PL81) is classified as a Less Developed region under EU Cohesion Policy 2021-2027.
- As a border region, it faces persistent service and labor-market pressure in the Russia-Ukraine war context.
- The policy problem is a triple challenge: regional disparity, decarbonization pressure, and social fairness.

## Slide 2. Problem and Policy Gap
- Assignment requires one package that addresses inequality, climate neutrality, and just transition at the same time.
- In current programming, Lubelskie is mainly ERDF+ESF+; JTF territorial coverage is limited.
- So we propose a phased design: ERDF implementation now, JTF-inclusive expansion in the next round.

## Slide 3. Strategy Overview (Two Stages)
- Stage 1 (2026-2029): ERDF-led package for energy efficiency, clean mobility, SME decarbonization, and skills.
- Stage 2 (2028-2034 scenario): JTF+ERDF package for transition-vulnerable workers and local diversification.
- Governance rule: one intervention logic, two funding windows, zero double financing.

## Slide 4. Stage 1 Detail (ERDF Window)
- Target groups: municipalities, SMEs, public institutions, and jobseekers in vulnerable districts.
- Instruments: building retrofit, low-emission transport, SME energy upgrade, and training-to-employment pathways.
- Expected result by 2029: lower energy burden, stronger local employment, and improved implementation capacity.

## Slide 5. Stage 2 Detail (JTF+ERDF Window)
- Trigger condition: next programming round allows Lubelskie under a just-transition territorial envelope.
- Instruments: worker transition support, local value-chain diversification, and brownfield regeneration.
- Expected result: lower concentration of transition risk and more durable regional convergence.
