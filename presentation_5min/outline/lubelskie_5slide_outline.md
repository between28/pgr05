# Lubelskie Core + Backup Outline (v2)

Use rule:
- `Core slides 1-5` for the final 5-minute briefing.
- `Backup slides 6-8` for team decision and Q&A only.
- Always pair `Draft value` and `Official update` when both exist.

## Core Deck (Slides 1-5)

## Slide 1. Why Lubelskie Now (PL2 + EU1 comparison)
Main claim:
- Lubelskie is the most policy-relevant target where eastern border pressure, low development, and transition vulnerability overlap.

Evidence anchors:
- Draft value (PPT S1, 2022): Lubelskie GDP per capita is about `54%` of EU average and lowest in Poland. [D1]
- Official update (Eurostat, 2023, GDP PPS EU=100):
  - `PL81 Lubelskie 53`
  - `PL82 Podkarpackie 55`
  - `PL22 Silesia 79`
  - `RO21 Nord-Est 47` [O1]
- Official update (Eurostat LFS, 2024 unemployment %):
  - `PL81 3.3`, `PL82 3.7`, `PL22 2.4`, `RO21 4.9` [O2]
- Official update (Eurostat AROPE, latest available in this series, 2020):
  - `PL81 26.6`, `PL82 22.6`, `PL22 12.2`, `RO21 41.4` [O3]

Visual:
- One comparison table with 3 indicators (GDP, unemployment, social vulnerability).

## Slide 2. Problem 1 (Baseline): Industrial Fragility
Main claim:
- Lubelskie has a single-pillar transition risk centered on coal-linked industry (Bogdanka ecosystem).

Evidence anchors:
- Draft value (PPT S5):
  - Poland thermal-coal demand projected `-47% to -58%` by 2030 vs 2025.
  - Bogdanka-linked livelihoods `20,000+`.
  - Bogdanka output around `6.2 Mt` by 2030.
  - EBITDA around `-30%` (2025-2027), negative FCF projection (2025-2031).
  - Labour cost share `32-39%`. [D2]
- Official update (OECD 2025 + programme context):
  - Lubelskie remains low-diversification and low-innovation in regional competitiveness.
  - Current executable pipeline in Lubelskie is ERDF+ESF+ first; post-2027 envelopes (including JTF scenarios) are handled as next-round planning. [O5][O8][O10]

Policy implication:
- Industrial contraction risk can spill over to jobs, municipal revenue, and investor confidence.

## Slide 3. Problem 2 (Baseline): Structural Labour + Demographic Pressure
Main claim:
- Labour-market fragility and demographic pressure make transition shock harder to absorb.

Evidence anchors:
- Draft value (PPT S6):
  - Employment concentration: agriculture `15%`, mining `17%`.
  - Youth unemployment `18.3%`.
  - Long-term unemployment share `35.5%`.
  - At-risk-of-poverty/social exclusion `26.6%`.
  - Old-age dependency ratio `35.2%`. [D3]
- Official update (GUS, Dec 2025 registered unemployment):
  - Lubelskie `8.1%`.
  - Hotspots: Wlodawski `17.8`, Hrubieszowski `16.3`, Krasnostawski `14.0`, Chelmski `13.4`. [O6]
- Official update (NOSG 2025 crossing pressure):
  - Ukraine-border persons `7,316,228`.
  - Ukraine-border trucks `818,322`. [O7]

Policy implication:
- Single-sector support is insufficient; labour transition and border-service resilience must be bundled.

## Slide 4. Policy Gap + Two-Track Strategy
Main claim:
- The key issue is sequencing and project architecture: use current ERDF/ESF+ calls now, while building a separate 2028-2034 investment portfolio.

Gap definition:
- Delivery sequencing gap:
  - Current Lubelskie calls can finance readiness and pilot operations now; larger portfolio envelopes are next-round decisions. [O8][O9][O10]
- Project-boundary gap:
  - Without legal separation between phases, audit and double-financing risk increases.

Two-track strategy:
- Track A (2026-2027 readiness operations):
  - Apply to current ERDF/ESF+ calls for pilot implementation, capability building, and procurement/design readiness. [O9]
- Track B (2028-2034 portfolio operations):
  - Launch separate scale projects (new contracts/project IDs) using ERDF + conditional JTF + ESF+ mix after post-2027 adoption. [O10]

Operational separation rule:
- The two phases are linked strategically but must be distinct operations:
  - separate project IDs and grant contracts
  - separate eligible-cost lines and budgets
  - separate output/result indicators and audit trails
  - no reuse of the same expenditure item across phases

Safe language:
- Confirmed fact: MFF proposal was published on `2025-07-16`.
- Scenario: final post-2027 rules, allocations, and territorial scope remain pending. [O10]

## Slide 5. Detailed Project Proposal + Expected Results
Program:
- `LUB-EAST Resilience & Transition Package (2026-2034)`

Project owner/partners:
- Lead: Lubelskie Marshal Office.
- Partners: Lublin city, Chelm/Hrubieszow/Wlodawa/Tomaszow local authorities, labour offices, transport/public-service operators.

Budget and period:
- Total `EUR 186m`
  - Stage 1 (2026-2027 pilot): `EUR 34m`
  - Stage 2 (2029-2034 scale-up): `EUR 152m`
- Components:
  - Mobility/logistics resilience `EUR 72m`
  - Clean heat/building retrofit `EUR 88m`
  - Skills/SME transition `EUR 26m` [O11]
- Fund split (scenario, total `EUR 186m`):
  - `ERDF EUR 104m` (`Stage 1: 20`, `Stage 2: 84`)
  - `JTF EUR 40m` (conditional, Stage 2)
  - `ESF+ EUR 10m` (`Stage 1: 3`, `Stage 2: 7`)
  - `National/local/other EUR 32m` (`Stage 1: 11`, `Stage 2: 21`)
- JTF condition note:
  - If Lubelskie is not covered by a post-2027 JTF envelope, the `EUR 40m` JTF line is replaced by ERDF/national co-financing scenario.

Target area:
- Lublin hub + eastern border corridors (Chelm-Hrubieszow-Wlodawa-Tomaszow axis).

Expected results:
- 2029 target (pilot stage):
  - `EUR 34m` contracted and implemented,
  - core pilot package operating in vulnerable border counties.
- 2034 target (scale stage):
  - full `EUR 186m` package delivered,
  - integrated infrastructure + labour transition model institutionalised. [O11]

## Backup Deck (Slides 6-8, not for final 5-minute core)

## Slide 6. Alternative A: Industrial Fragility + Labour Structure
Definition:
- Problem 1 = industrial contraction exposure.
- Problem 2 = labour-market and demographic rigidity.

Core evidence:
- Draft-heavy with official unemployment/border updates. [D2][D3][O6][O7]

Policy-gap focus:
- Missing dedicated transition labour envelope under current architecture.

Two-track pros/cons:
- Pro: strongest transition-governance logic.
- Con: depends more on labour-program implementation capacity.

## Slide 7. Alternative B: Industrial Fragility + Energy Poverty/Environmental Health
Definition:
- Problem 1 = industrial contraction exposure.
- Problem 2 = household energy burden and pollution health cost.

Core evidence:
- Draft S5 + Draft S7, plus official retrofit programme signals. [D2][D4][O11]

Policy-gap focus:
- Current system underintegrates industrial transition and household welfare protection.

Two-track pros/cons:
- Pro: strongest social acceptability framing.
- Con: harder to establish short-run labour outcomes in 5-minute core.

## Slide 8. Alternative C: Labour Structure + Energy Poverty/Environmental Health
Definition:
- Problem 1 = labour/demographic stress.
- Problem 2 = energy burden + health externalities.

Core evidence:
- Draft S6 + S7 with official unemployment/border updates. [D3][D4][O6][O7]

Policy-gap focus:
- Fragmented labour and welfare instruments are not enough for place-based transition.

Two-track pros/cons:
- Pro: strongest equity narrative.
- Con: weaker direct link to Bogdanka-centred industrial-risk storyline.
