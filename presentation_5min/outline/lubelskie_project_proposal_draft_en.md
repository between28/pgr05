# Lubelskie ERDF + JTF Proposal (5-Slide English Briefing)

## Slide 1. Why Lubelskie
- Lubelskie is an EU Less Developed region (NUTS-2 PL81), with structural regional gap and lower income base than the EU and Poland average.
- It is exposed to border-region pressures, demographic aging, and public-service gaps.
- The same intervention is needed to tackle: regional inequality, climate-transition risk, and social fairness.

## Slide 2. Why the Proposal Is Credible
- The assignment asks for ERDF and JTF together; we frame this as a two-window, one strategy.
- Current baseline: ERDF is available for Lubelskie; JTF is currently constrained and assumed to be open in the next period.
- Therefore: use the 2028–2034 cycle as the implementation scenario, with ERDF-ready preparation in advance.

## Slide 3. Stage 1: ERDF Package (Foundation)
- Focus: clean public infrastructure and small/medium enterprise transition capacity.
- Core actions: energy-efficient municipal buildings, low-emission local mobility, and SME energy upgrades.
- Direct outcomes by 2029: lower energy costs, stronger local job capacity, faster project execution readiness.

## Slide 4. Stage 2: JTF Layer (Transition Support)
- Focus: workers and communities most exposed to green transition.
- Core actions: re-training with job matching, conversion support for vulnerable local supply chains, and brownfield repurposing.
- Direct outcomes by 2034: lower social stress from transition, reduced regional lock-in, stable transition governance.

## Slide 5. One Program, Two Funds, One Logic
- ERDF and JTF do not replace each other; they are sequenced in the same regional contract.
- No double financing: stage-specific costs, stage-specific beneficiaries, shared monitoring indicators.
- Decision point for EU: one package that reduces inequality now and reduces transition damage later.
