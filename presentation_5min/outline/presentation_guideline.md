# Presentation Guideline Notes

This file stores operational notes for briefing preparation.

## Case Lock
- Region: Lubelskie (PL81)
- Delivery mode: one presenter, 5-minute briefing + 5-10 minute Q&A
- Funding logic: phased design (current ERDF + next-round JTF scenario)

## Build Order
1. separate current facts and scenario assumptions
2. lock one-line policy ask
3. prepare 5-slide flow (problem -> strategy -> stage 1 -> stage 2)
4. prepare Q&A by risk topic (eligibility, money, governance, evaluation)
5. rehearse to 5:00 and keep one backup slide for Q&A

## Quality Check
- each slide has one claim and one evidence anchor
- no claim of immediate JTF disbursement without eligibility trigger
- stage 1 remains valuable even if stage 2 is delayed
