# PT Guideline (Reconstructed)

## Goal
Deliver a 5-minute policy briefing (team of 3) to persuade EU decision-makers to fund the proposed project.

## Mandatory Conditions

1. Select one region classified as a Less Developed region under EU Cohesion Policy.
2. Simultaneously address:
   - regional inequality reduction
   - contribution to climate neutrality
   - fair/just support for citizens negatively affected by transition
3. Funding design must combine at least:
   - ERDF (European Regional Development Fund)
   - JTF (Just Transition Fund)
4. Format:
   - max 5 slides
   - 5-minute oral briefing

## Recommended Slide Logic

1. Why this region, why now
2. Intervention package (what/who/how)
3. Evidence that the package can work
4. ERDF-JTF funding split and governance
5. Outcomes, just-transition safeguards, and funding ask

## Evaluation Focus

- policy fit with assignment constraints
- evidence quality (not idea-only)
- implementation feasibility (budget, target, delivery path)
- persuasion under time pressure
- originality/strategic coherence
