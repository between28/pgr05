# Lubelskie Detailed Speaker Notes (5-min + Q&A)

## Positioning
- This briefing uses a strict split between `current confirmed facts` and `future policy scenario`.
- Stage 1 is based on currently available ERDF implementation pathways in Lubelskie.
- Stage 2 is a bounded JTF-inclusive scenario for the next programming period.

## Slide-by-slide Notes

### Slide 1 (0:00-1:00): Why Lubelskie now
- State three facts only:
  1. Lubelskie is PL81 and classified as Less Developed in 2021-2027 regional classification.
  2. It is a border region with sustained pressure in the war context.
  3. Existing regional gaps make transition distributionally sensitive.
- Keep this slide diagnostic, not solution-heavy.

### Slide 2 (1:00-2:00): Problem and policy gap
- Explain assignment requirement: inequality + climate + just transition in one package.
- Explain institutional gap: current Lubelskie implementation is ERDF+ESF+ centered; JTF access is more constrained.
- Transition sentence: therefore a phased architecture is more credible than a single-window claim.

### Slide 3 (2:00-3:00): Two-stage strategy
- Stage 1 (2026-2029): ERDF-led immediate actions.
- Stage 2 (2028-2034 scenario): conditional JTF+ERDF expansion.
- Design safeguard: no double financing, separate indicators and audit trail.

### Slide 4 (3:00-4:00): Stage 1 details
- Who: municipalities, public service providers, SMEs, vulnerable jobseekers.
- What: retrofit, mobility, SME energy conversion, training-to-employment.
- Why credible: matches currently used ERDF implementation logic and open-call structure.

### Slide 5 (4:00-5:00): Stage 2 details and final ask
- Condition: future territorial eligibility or equivalent transition priority is formally opened.
- What scales: worker transition support, diversification, brownfield reuse.
- Final ask: approve phased implementation now, with pre-agreed governance trigger for Stage 2.

## Q&A Bank (5-10 min)

### Q1. Is this legally feasible if JTF is mandatory?
A1. Yes, as a policy proposal with explicit two-stage governance. Stage 1 is current-feasible ERDF. Stage 2 is conditional and tied to next-round eligibility decisions.

### Q2. Why not choose a current JTF-core region instead?
A2. This design intentionally tests whether a border Less Developed region can be made transition-ready without over-claiming current JTF access.

### Q3. Are you assuming uncertain money?
A3. We separate confirmed current financing from scenario financing. No current disbursement claim is made for non-approved JTF territorial status.

### Q4. How are funds allocated in practice?
A4. EU sets legal/program envelopes, Poland and regional managing authorities launch calls, projects are selected through eligibility and quality scoring, then audited through output/result indicators.

### Q5. How do you evaluate success?
A5. Track outputs (projects, trainees, retrofits), short-run results (employment transition, energy burden), and medium-run outcomes (regional convergence and transition-risk reduction).

### Q6. What is the key risk?
A6. Stage 2 trigger risk. Mitigation is to make Stage 1 valuable on its own and keep Stage 2 modular.
