# Lubelskie Detailed Speaker Notes (Core 5 + Backup 6-8)

## Positioning
- Final delivery is `5 slides / 5 minutes` (Core 1-5).
- Slides `6-8` are backup only for team decision and Q&A.
- We keep a strict split between `confirmed facts` and `scenario assumptions`.

## Data Pairing Protocol (mandatory)
- When a metric appears in both old deck and updated evidence, use this syntax:
  - `Draft value (PPT Sx, year): ... [D#]`
  - `Official update (source, date/year): ... [O#]`
- Never merge conflicting years into one synthetic number.
- If years differ, say the year explicitly in speech.

## Slide-by-slide Notes (Core 1-5)

### Slide 1 (0:00-1:00) Why Lubelskie now
Objective:
- Establish why Lubelskie is the selected region under a comparative frame.

Talk track:
1. Draft baseline: 54% of EU GDP per capita and lowest in Poland in the draft year. [D1]
2. Official comparison (same indicator family): GDP PPS EU=100 in 2023:
   - PL81 53, PL82 55, PL22 79, RO21 47. [O1]
3. Official vulnerability context:
   - Unemployment (LFS 2024): PL81 3.3, PL82 3.7, PL22 2.4, RO21 4.9. [O2]
   - AROPE (latest available in this series): PL81 26.6, PL82 22.6, PL22 12.2, RO21 41.4. [O3]

Do not:
- Do not over-claim direct cross-country causality from one indicator.

### Slide 2 (1:00-2:00) Problem 1: industrial fragility
Objective:
- Show single-pillar industrial transition risk.

Talk track:
1. Draft industrial-risk bundle from PPT S5:
   - coal demand contraction, Bogdanka-linked livelihoods, output/finance pressure. [D2]
2. Official contextual update:
   - diversification/innovation weakness remains.
   - current executable pathway is ERDF+ESF+ first, with next-round envelope planning in parallel. [O8][O10]
3. Policy implication:
   - risk transmission to labour, local fiscal base, and investor sentiment.

### Slide 3 (2:00-3:00) Problem 2: labour + demographic pressure
Objective:
- Show that labour-market fragility is structural, not temporary.

Talk track:
1. Draft structure from PPT S6:
   - sector concentration, youth/long-term vulnerability, dependency pressure. [D3]
2. Official local stress update:
   - GUS 2025-12 registered unemployment 8.1% in Lubelskie, with high-county hotspots. [O6]
3. Official border-pressure update:
   - 2025 crossings: 7.3m persons, 818k trucks. [O7]

Do not:
- Do not mix LFS unemployment and registered unemployment as identical measures.

### Slide 4 (3:00-4:00) Policy gap + two-track strategy
Objective:
- Explain sequencing logic and legal separation between phases.

Talk track:
1. Sequencing point:
   - current calls can finance readiness operations now; larger envelopes are next-round decisions. [O9][O10]
2. Two-track:
   - Track A (2026-2027): separate readiness projects via ERDF/ESF+ calls (pilot, design/procurement readiness, implementation capacity). [O9]
   - Track B (2028-2034): separate scale projects with new contracts/project IDs (ERDF + conditional JTF + ESF+) after post-2027 adoption. [O10]
3. Separation rule:
   - no duplicated expenditure item; contracts, cost lines, indicators, and audit trails must be phase-specific.

Safe sentence:
- `Our logic is continuity in strategy, but strict separation in operations and financing across phases.`

### Slide 5 (4:00-5:00) detailed project + expected results
Objective:
- Land one concrete, implementable package with staged budget and timeline.

Talk track:
1. Program: LUB-EAST package 2026-2034. [O11]
2. Budget:
   - total EUR 186m = EUR 34m pilot + EUR 152m scale-up. [O11]
3. Components:
   - mobility/logistics 72m, clean heat/retrofit 88m, skills/SME 26m. [O11]
4. Results framing:
   - 2029: pilot contracted and operating.
   - 2034: full package delivered in Lublin hub + eastern corridors.

Closing ask:
- approve implementation-ready Track A and conditional governance-ready Track B.

## Backup Slides (6-8) Usage Rules

### Slide 6 Alternative A: industrial + labour
- Use when panel prioritizes transition governance and workforce shock absorption.
- Evidence pair: [D2][D3] + [O6][O7]

### Slide 7 Alternative B: industrial + energy poverty/environmental health
- Use when panel prioritizes social acceptance and household burden.
- Evidence pair: [D2][D4] + [O11]

### Slide 8 Alternative C: labour + energy poverty/environmental health
- Use when panel prioritizes equity and social protection.
- Evidence pair: [D3][D4] + [O6][O7]

## Q&A Guardrails
- If asked why not immediate JTF:
  - state that the design is sequencing-first: apply current ERDF/ESF+ calls now and launch separate scale projects in the next envelope. [O9][O10]
- If asked about number inconsistency:
  - clarify indicator family and year (Draft vs Official update).
- If asked whether 6-8 are part of final deck:
  - answer: no, they are backup decision slides only.
