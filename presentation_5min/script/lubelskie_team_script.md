## 0:00-1:00 | Slide 1
Good afternoon. Our case is Lubelskie (PL81) in Poland.
It is a Less Developed region, and as a border territory it has faced sustained pressure on services and labor markets.
Our core task is to address inequality, climate neutrality, and fairness in one coherent package.

## 1:00-2:00 | Slide 2
The assignment requires a combined ERDF+JTF architecture.
However, Lubelskie is currently implemented mainly through ERDF+ESF+, while JTF territorial eligibility is tighter.
So we propose a realistic two-stage model: immediate ERDF delivery and a next-round JTF-inclusive expansion.

## 2:00-3:00 | Slide 3
Stage 1 is ERDF-led implementation in 2026-2029.
Stage 2 is a 2028-2034 scenario combining JTF+ERDF for transition-vulnerable groups.
The governance principle is simple: one policy logic, separate funding windows, no double financing.

## 3:00-4:00 | Slide 4
Stage 1 targets municipalities, public bodies, SMEs, and jobseekers in vulnerable districts.
Instruments include building retrofit, clean mobility, SME energy upgrades, and training-to-employment links.
Expected results are lower energy burden, greener jobs, and stronger local implementation capacity.

## 4:00-5:00 | Slide 5 + Close
Stage 2 starts only if Lubelskie is included under a just-transition territorial envelope or equivalent priority in the next round.
Instruments are worker transition support, diversification of local value chains, and brownfield regeneration.
Our ask is to approve an evidence-based phased package that is compliant now and expandable later.

## Fast Q&A (5-10 min)
- Why Lubelskie? Less Developed status, border pressure, and structural disparity overlap in one territory.
- Why two stages? It manages legal feasibility now while preserving strategic ambition.
- Why not immediate JTF disbursement? Current territorial/program constraints make phased deployment more compliant.
- How is double funding avoided? Separate indicators, target groups, and implementation lines by stage.
