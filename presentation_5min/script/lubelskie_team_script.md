## 0:00-1:00 | Slide 1: Why Lubelskie now
Our target is Lubelskie, because it combines border pressure, low development, and transition vulnerability in one place.
Draft evidence in our deck says Lubelskie was around 54% of EU GDP per capita in 2022.
Official comparison update confirms the gap remains deep in 2023: PL81 is 53, while Silesia is 79 in the same EU=100 index.
In short, Lubelskie is not only a weak region, but a weak region under border-system pressure.

## 1:00-2:00 | Slide 2: Problem 1 (industrial fragility)
The first problem is single-pillar industrial fragility around coal-linked activity.
Our draft baseline shows projected coal-demand contraction, pressure on Bogdanka-linked livelihoods, and deterioration risk in company financial resilience.
Officially, Lubelskie still shows weak diversification, and current executable financing is ERDF+ESF+ first with next-round portfolio preparation in parallel.
So the risk is not only industrial output decline, but spillover into jobs and local fiscal stability.

## 2:00-3:00 | Slide 3: Problem 2 (labour + demographic pressure)
The second problem is structural labour-market and demographic pressure.
Draft indicators show concentration in traditional sectors, high long-term vulnerability, and aging pressure.
Official 2025 registered unemployment is 8.1% in Lubelskie, with much higher levels in several eastern counties.
At the same time, border crossings handled over 7.3 million persons and 818 thousand trucks in 2025, which raises service-load volatility.

## 3:00-4:00 | Slide 4: Policy gap + two-track strategy
Our key point is sequencing, not funding absence.
Track A in 2026-2027 applies to current ERDF/ESF+ calls for pilots, implementation capability, and procurement readiness.
Track B in 2028-2034 launches separate scale projects with new contracts and project IDs, using ERDF plus conditional JTF and ESF+ after post-2027 adoption.
These two phases are strategically linked, but legally distinct operations.
So we keep continuity in goals, while avoiding duplicated cost claims.

## 4:00-5:00 | Slide 5: detailed project + expected results
We propose one integrated package: LUB-EAST Resilience and Transition, 2026-2034.
Total budget is EUR 186 million:
EUR 34 million in the pilot stage and EUR 152 million in the scale stage.
The package combines mobility resilience, clean heat and retrofit, and skills plus SME transition.
Our ask is to approve this phased design: implementation-ready now, expansion-ready once post-2027 conditions are formalized.

## Backup Use Only (Slides 6-8, not in core 5-minute run)
- Slide 6: Alternative A = industrial fragility + labour structure.
- Slide 7: Alternative B = industrial fragility + energy poverty/environmental health.
- Slide 8: Alternative C = labour structure + energy poverty/environmental health.
- Use these only when the panel asks which problem-pairing gives the strongest policy fit.

## Fast Q&A (5-10 min)
- Why Lubelskie instead of a current JTF-core region?
  - Because this is a harder but policy-relevant test case where border pressure and low development overlap.
- Are we claiming uncertain money as confirmed?
  - No. We separate confirmed current implementation from post-2027 scenario expansion.
- How do we avoid double financing?
  - Separate contracts, cost lines, outputs, and audit trails by phase.
- Why keep draft and official values together?
  - Draft explains the original team logic; official values update comparability and credibility.
