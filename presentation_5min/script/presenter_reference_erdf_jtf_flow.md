# Presenter Reference: ERDF/JTF Flow (for speaker only)

## 1) Key Clarification
ERDF/JTF projects are generally **not** submitted directly to the European Commission as ordinary local project applications.
They are implemented under **shared management**:
- EU institutions set legal framework and envelopes.
- Member state and regional managing authorities run calls and select projects.

## 2) End-to-End Flow

1. EU legal framework is adopted.
   - Common Provisions Regulation (CPR)
   - ERDF Regulation
   - JTF Regulation

2. EU sets country and regional framework.
   - Regional eligibility classification (Less developed / transition / more developed)
   - Member-state financial allocations

3. Poland prepares programming package.
   - Partnership Agreement
   - National/regional programmes
   - Territorial Just Transition Plans (TJTP) for JTF territories

4. European Commission approves programme documents.

5. Managing authorities launch calls.
   - each call defines: eligible applicants, activities, co-financing rate, selection criteria, timeline

6. Applicants submit proposals to the relevant managing/intermediate authority.

7. Evaluation and contracting.
   - formal eligibility check
   - substantive scoring
   - selection decision
   - grant agreement

8. Implementation, reporting, audit, reimbursement.

## 3) Who is the managing authority in Silesia?
In practical programme governance terms, the managing authority role is carried by:
- `Instytucja Zarzadzajaca programem Fundusze Europejskie dla Slaskiego 2021-2027 (IZ FE SL)`
- institutionally performed by `Zarzad Wojewodztwa Slaskiego`.

## 4) Practical Message for Q&A
- "Can we directly ask Brussels for ERDF/JTF money?"
  - Usually no for regional project grants.
  - You apply through programme calls run by national/regional authorities under approved programmes.

- "If Poland still has money, can any region freely take JTF?"
  - No. JTF is tied to approved transition territories and plans.
  - Reallocation beyond those rules requires programme-level amendment and Commission approval.
