# Presenter Reference: ERDF/JTF Flow for Lubelskie Case

## One-line model
EU sets the rulebook and envelopes, Polish authorities run programme calls, and projects are selected, contracted, monitored, and audited under shared management.

## Step-by-step (easy version)
1. EU adopts regulations and allocation logic.
2. Poland translates this into national/regional programmes and priorities.
3. Managing authorities publish calls with eligibility and scoring criteria.
4. Applicants submit projects; formal and substantive evaluation follows.
5. Selected projects sign agreements and implement with reporting obligations.
6. Payments are tied to eligible expenditure and verified outputs/results.
7. Ex post evaluation and audit check compliance, effectiveness, and value.

## What this means for Lubelskie
- Current window: ERDF-centered implementation is directly usable.
- JTF window: currently tighter territorial logic; use as conditional next-round scenario in this project design.

## Funding logic for this presentation
- Stage 1 (current facts): ERDF actions that are already consistent with programme practice.
- Stage 2 (bounded scenario): JTF+ERDF expansion if territorial eligibility/priority is formally opened.
