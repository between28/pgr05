# Silesia Detailed Speaker Notes (5-min + Q&A)

## Use
This is a presenter-only note file for:
- precise talking points
- evidence anchors
- likely Q&A responses with source links

## Slide 1. Why Silesia now (0:00-1:00)

### Core claim
Silesia (PL22) is an appropriate case because it combines:
- Less Developed region status in the 2021-2027 framework
- concentrated transition pressure from coal and carbon-intensive industry

### Why this matters
If climate decarbonisation is advanced without targeted regional adjustment, distributional backlash and implementation failure risk increase.

### Evidence anchors
- Regional classification framework: Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/1130
- ERDF/JTF policy context: Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and 2021/1056
- Poland programme approval context: EC press material on Poland 2021-2027 package

## Slide 2. Intervention design (1:00-2:00)

### Package
1. Green Skills Track
- short-cycle reskilling for transition-risk workers
- youth entry pathways linked to local employers

2. Clean Industry Conversion Track
- SME advisory and capex support for low-carbon conversion
- staged milestones (audit -> pilot -> scaling)

### Delivery logic
- municipality-level targeting
- worker-support and firm-support delivered as a linked package

## Slide 3. Why this should work (2:00-3:00)

### Causal logic
- place heterogeneity requires place-based policy design
- transition costs are uneven across space and groups
- social acceptance improves when adjustment burdens are addressed explicitly

### Literature anchors
- Barca, McCann, Rodriguez-Pose (2012): place-based rationale
- recent just-transition distributional literature
- empirical evidence on just transition and political acceptance

## Slide 4. ERDF/JTF split (3:00-4:00)

### No-overlap funding rule
- ERDF: innovation/productivity/infrastructure investments
- JTF: worker transition support and local diversification tied to transition shock

### Governance rule
- separate indicators
- separate budget lines
- clear lead authority per workstream

### Q&A defense line
"Integration of objectives does not mean mixing accounting lines."

## Slide 5. Outcomes and ask (4:00-5:00)

### Expected outcomes
- Equity: reduced transition-driven inequality
- Climate: faster decarbonisation in high-exposure local economy
- Governance: implementable package within programme rules

### Funding ask
Support this package as an immediately actionable, evidence-based project architecture under the 2021-2027 framework.

## Anticipated Q&A (extended)

### Q1. Why not Lubelskie?
A1. Lubelskie is strong for ERDF/ESF+ development logic, but JTF fit is weaker under current approved territorial setup. If assignment requires mandatory ERDF+JTF, Silesia reduces compliance risk.

### Q2. Can we directly apply to the European Commission?
A2. Typically no for these regional project grants. Applications go through managing authorities under approved programmes (shared management).

### Q3. Are funds already fully committed?
A3. Programme envelopes are fixed, but calls continue during implementation windows. Projects can still be submitted if relevant calls are open.

### Q4. What prevents double funding?
A4. Design controls: separate eligible actions, beneficiaries, indicators, and reporting lines by fund.

### Q5. Is this just an idea or implementable?
A5. It is implementable because it is mapped to existing fund logic (ERDF investment + JTF transition support) and existing programme governance.
