## Time Plan (5:00)
- Speaker A: 0:00-1:40 (Slide 1-2)

- Speaker C: 3:20-5:00 (Slide 5 + close)

## Speaker A

### 0:00-0:50 | Slide 1
Good afternoon. We propose a place-based transition package for Silesia (PL22), combining ERDF and JTF.
Silesia is classified as a Less Developed region, and it is also one of the most exposed coal-transition territories.
If climate and regional policy are designed separately here, implementation risk rises sharply.

### 0:50-1:40 | Slide 2
Our intervention has two pillars.
First, Green Skills: reskilling and job-matching for transition-risk workers and young job seekers.
Second, Clean Industry Conversion: phased support for local SMEs to decarbonize production.
Delivery is municipality-targeted so design reflects local industrial structure and vulnerability.

## Speaker B

### 1:40-2:30 | Slide 3
Why should this work?
First, evidence shows place-based strategies perform better where territorial heterogeneity is high.
Second, green-transition costs are spatially uneven, so vulnerable regions require front-loaded support.
Third, just-transition agreements can increase social acceptance of climate policy.

### 2:30-3:20 | Slide 4
Funding roles are clearly split.
ERDF finances productivity, innovation, and infrastructure.
JTF finances transition-shock mitigation: reskilling, labor adjustment, and local diversification.
To avoid overlap, we separate output indicators, target groups, and implementation responsibility.

## Speaker C

### 3:20-4:20 | Slide 5
We expect two core results.
First, reduced inequality by protecting transition-vulnerable groups.
Second, faster climate-neutral restructuring in high-exposure territories.
The package is built to deliver both speed and fairness.

### 4:20-5:00 | Close
This is an evidence-based project that can be implemented within the 2021-2027 framework.
The ERDF-JTF split makes execution and accountability realistic.
We request support for this package. Thank you.

## Fast Q&A Lines
- Why Silesia? It has strong JTF fit and concentrated transition exposure, reducing assignment-compliance risk.
- Why combine ERDF and JTF? Growth investment and transition protection must be linked but not conflated.
- How do you avoid double funding? We separate indicators, beneficiaries, and delivery responsibility by package.
