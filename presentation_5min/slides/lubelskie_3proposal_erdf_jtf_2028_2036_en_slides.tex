\slide{Lubelskie (PL81): ERDF + JTF Program Proposals}{
3 packages for ERDF + JTF, 2028--2036 scenario.\
Purpose: reduce regional inequality, support climate transition, and secure fair outcomes.
}

\slide{Package 1: Energy-Poverty Reduction and Carbon-Ready Housing}{
ERDF (2028--2032): retrofit public buildings and old housing; heat-pump pilots; smart metering; SME energy-efficiency support.\
JTF (2030--2034, 2036 scale-up): retraining for building maintenance, heating, and related jobs; workforce transition support.\
Indicative scale: ERDF €28--35m / JTF €14--20m.\
Expected impact: 12,000 dwellings targeted, winter energy costs down 10--15\%, 2,500 workers re-skilled.\
No double funding: different activities and beneficiaries by fund and phase.
}

\slide{Package 2: Low-Carbon Mobility and Eastern Corridor Connectivity}{
ERDF (2028--2034): clean bus links in city--periphery--rural routes; route electrification for short corridors; ITS and fare integration.\
JTF (2029--2036): transport-mechanics and EV maintenance training, operator transition support, supplier reorientation.\
Indicative scale: ERDF €45--60m / JTF €14--26m.\
Expected impact: public-transport share +8--12pp, average commuting time -8 to 12 minutes, post-training employment >60\% within 6 months.
}

\slide{Package 3: Rural Diversification and Just-Transition Industrial Value Chain}{
ERDF (2029--2036): agri-bio processing, low-carbon logistics nodes, SME digital and decarbonisation upgrades in rural areas.\
JTF (2031--2036): transition package for coal-linked and vulnerable workers; social support and placement partnerships.\
Indicative scale: ERDF €40--57m / JTF €16--24m.\
Expected impact: 40 new low-carbon SMEs, stronger regional employment resilience, 4,000 vulnerable workers retained or re-employed.
