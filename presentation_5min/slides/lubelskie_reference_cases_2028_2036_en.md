# Lubelskie Reference Cases (ERDF/JTF, 2028–2036)

## Slide 1. Purpose and Use Case
- Practical benchmark deck for a Lubelskie ERDF+JTF proposal (2028–2036 implementation scenario).
- Shows how **ERDF supports infrastructure and competitiveness**, while **JTF supports transition workers and social protection**.

## Slide 2. ERDF References (2 cases)
- **ERDF Case 1 — S19 Lublin–Lubartów (northern section)**
  - Total project value: 1,394.8m PLN
  - EU support: 612.1m PLN
  - Period: 2021–2028
  - Message: transport accessibility improvement as a growth foundation in a lower-income region.

- **ERDF Case 2 — Lublin Integrated Public Transport expansion**
  - EU support: 190.7m PLN
  - Period: 2023–2029
  - Message: strengthening mobility for peripheral and rural catchments through cleaner fleet and service upgrades.

## Slide 3. JTF References (2 cases)
- **JTF Case 1 — Konin “Droga do zatrudnienia po węglu”**
  - EU support: 180.0m PLN
  - Period: 2023–2029
  - Message: re-skilling + employment linkage for workers at risk in transition zones.

- **JTF Case 2 — Śląskie zero-emission mobility package**
  - EU support: 132.0m PLN
  - Period: 2025–2029
  - Message: labour-transition design for industrial regions combining technology shift and workforce adjustment.

## Slide 4. What to Apply to Lubelskie
- ERDF logic: prioritize infrastructure, transit access, and low-carbon production capacity first.
- JTF logic: target transition-vulnerable groups (low-income households, maintenance/transport/energy service workers) with re-skilling and placement support.
- Proposal rule of thumb:
  - ERDF per package: **€28–57m** (indicative band)
  - JTF per package: **€14–26m** (indicative band)
  - Sequencing principle: one regional package, two funds, one narrative.
