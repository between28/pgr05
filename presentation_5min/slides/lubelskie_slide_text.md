# Lubelskie Slide Text (Core 1-5 + Backup 6-8)

Usage:
- `Slides 1-5`: final 5-minute briefing.
- `Slides 6-8`: backup for team decision/Q&A.

## Slide 1. Why Lubelskie Now (PL2 + EU1 comparison)
- Core message: Lubelskie is where border pressure, low development, and transition vulnerability overlap.
- Draft value (PPT S1, 2022): GDP per capita about `54%` of EU average; lowest in Poland. [D1]
- Official update (GDP PPS EU=100, 2023): `PL81 53`, `PL82 55`, `PL22 79`, `RO21 47`. [O1]
- Official update (LFS unemployment %, 2024): `PL81 3.3`, `PL82 3.7`, `PL22 2.4`, `RO21 4.9`. [O2]
- Official update (AROPE %, latest in this series, 2020): `PL81 26.6`, `PL82 22.6`, `PL22 12.2`, `RO21 41.4`. [O3]

## Slide 2. Problem 1: Industrial Fragility (single-pillar risk)
- Draft value (PPT S5): coal demand `-47% to -58%` by 2030 vs 2025; Bogdanka-linked livelihoods `20,000+`; output around `6.2 Mt` by 2030. [D2]
- Draft value (PPT S5): EBITDA about `-30%` (2025-2027), projected negative FCF (2025-2031), labour cost share `32-39%`. [D2]
- Official update: Lubelskie remains weak in diversification/innovation, and current executable funding is ERDF+ESF+ first with post-2027 portfolio scenarios prepared in parallel. [O4][O8][O10]
- Policy implication: industrial contraction can spill over to jobs, municipal finance, and investment confidence.

## Slide 3. Problem 2: Structural Labour + Demographic Pressure
- Draft value (PPT S6): agriculture `15%`, mining `17%`, youth unemployment `18.3%`, long-term unemployment share `35.5%`, old-age dependency `35.2%`. [D3]
- Draft value (PPT S6): at risk of poverty/social exclusion `26.6%`. [D3]
- Official update (GUS, Dec 2025 registered unemployment): Lubelskie `8.1%`; hotspots `Wlodawski 17.8`, `Hrubieszowski 16.3`, `Krasnostawski 14.0`, `Chelmski 13.4`. [O6]
- Official update (NOSG, 2025): Ukraine-border traffic `7,316,228 persons` and `818,322 trucks`. [O7]
- Policy implication: labour transition and border-service resilience must be funded together.

## Slide 4. Policy Gap + Two-Track Strategy
- Sequencing point: this is not a funding absence story; it is a sequencing-and-architecture story.
- Track A (2026-2027): apply to current ERDF/ESF+ calls for pilots, implementation capability, and procurement/design readiness. [O9]
- Track B (2028-2034): launch separate scale projects (new contracts/IDs) with ERDF + conditional JTF + ESF+ after post-2027 adoption. [O10]
- Separation rule: strategic continuity is allowed, but costs/contracts/indicators/audit trails must be distinct across phases.
- Compliance rule: no duplicated expenditure item across 2026-2027 and 2028-2034 operations.

## Slide 5. Detailed Project Proposal + Expected Results
- Program: `LUB-EAST Resilience & Transition Package (2026-2034)`. [O11]
- Governance: Lubelskie Marshal Office lead + Lublin/Chelm/Hrubieszow/Wlodawa/Tomaszow authorities, labour offices, and transport/public-service operators.
- Budget: total `EUR 186m` = Stage 1 `EUR 34m` (2026-2027 pilot) + Stage 2 `EUR 152m` (2029-2034 scale-up). [O11]
- Components: mobility/logistics `EUR 72m`; clean heat/retrofit `EUR 88m`; skills/SME transition `EUR 26m`. [O11]
- Fund split (scenario):
  - `ERDF EUR 104m` (`20` in Stage 1 + `84` in Stage 2)
  - `JTF EUR 40m` (conditional, Stage 2 only)
  - `ESF+ EUR 10m` (`3` in Stage 1 + `7` in Stage 2)
  - `National/local/other EUR 32m` (`11` in Stage 1 + `21` in Stage 2)
- Contingency:
  - If JTF is not opened for Lubelskie, the `EUR 40m` JTF line is replaced by ERDF/national co-financing.
- Expected results:
  - by 2029: pilot package operational and budget `EUR 34m` delivered;
  - by 2034: full `EUR 186m` package implemented in Lublin hub + eastern border corridors. [O11]

## Slide 6 (Backup). Alternative A: Industrial Fragility + Labour Structure
- Definition: Problem 1 = industrial contraction; Problem 2 = labour/demographic rigidity.
- Evidence pairing: [D2][D3] + [O6][O7]
- Policy-gap focus: missing dedicated transition-labour envelope under current architecture.
- Two-track trade-off: strongest transition governance logic; requires higher labour-programme execution capacity.

## Slide 7 (Backup). Alternative B: Industrial Fragility + Energy Poverty/Environmental Health
- Definition: Problem 1 = industrial contraction; Problem 2 = energy burden and pollution health costs.
- Evidence pairing: [D2][D4] + current retrofit evidence/proposal design [O11]
- Policy-gap focus: weak integration between industrial transition and household welfare protection.
- Two-track trade-off: strongest social acceptability narrative; weaker immediate labour KPI visibility.

## Slide 8 (Backup). Alternative C: Labour Structure + Energy Poverty/Environmental Health
- Definition: Problem 1 = labour/demographic stress; Problem 2 = energy/health burden.
- Evidence pairing: [D3][D4] + [O6][O7]
- Policy-gap focus: fragmented labour and welfare tools cannot manage place-based transition shock.
- Two-track trade-off: strongest equity framing; weaker direct Bogdanka-risk linkage.
