# Lubelskie 5-Slide Text (English)

## Slide 1. Why Lubelskie Now
- Lubelskie (PL81) is classified as a Less Developed region under EU Cohesion Policy 2021-2027.
- As a border region, it faces persistent service and labor-market pressure in the Russia-Ukraine war context.
- The core policy challenge is to handle inequality, climate neutrality, and fairness together.

## Slide 2. Problem and Policy Gap
- The assignment requires a combined ERDF+JTF architecture.
- In current programming, Lubelskie is mainly under ERDF+ESF+, with limited JTF territorial coverage.
- Our design is phased: ERDF implementation now, JTF-inclusive expansion in the next round.

## Slide 3. Strategy Overview (Two Stages)
- Stage 1 (2026-2029): ERDF-led package for energy efficiency, clean mobility, SME decarbonization, and skills.
- Stage 2 (2028-2034 scenario): JTF+ERDF package for transition-vulnerable workers and local diversification.
- Rule: one policy logic, two funding windows, no double financing.

## Slide 4. Stage 1 Detail: ERDF Window
- Target: municipalities, public institutions, SMEs, and jobseekers in vulnerable districts.
- Instruments: building retrofit, low-emission transport, SME energy upgrades, training-to-employment links.
- Expected result by 2029: lower energy burden, greener jobs, stronger implementation capacity.

## Slide 5. Stage 2 Detail: JTF+ERDF Window
- Condition: Lubelskie is included in a just-transition territorial envelope or equivalent priority in the next round.
- Instruments: worker transition support, value-chain diversification, and brownfield regeneration.
- Expected result: lower transition-risk concentration and more durable regional convergence.
