# Silesia 5-Slide Text (English)

## Slide 1. Why Silesia Now
- Silesia (PL22) is classified as a Less Developed region under EU Cohesion Policy 2021-2027.
- At the same time, this is a core coal-transition region, so separating climate policy from regional policy creates high implementation risk.
- Proposal: a place-based ERDF+JTF package that delivers both inequality reduction and climate neutrality.

## Slide 2. Intervention Design: What, for Whom, and How
- Core package: Green Skills + Clean Industry Conversion (tailored to carbon-intensive local economies).
- Target groups: workers at transition risk, young job seekers, and local SMEs.
- Delivery model: municipality-level targeting, training-to-employment pathways, and phased SME transition support.

## Slide 3. Evidence: Why This Works
- Place-based policy performs better when designed for local context.
- Green-transition costs are spatially uneven, so vulnerable regions need early and targeted support.
- There is empirical evidence that just-transition agreements can increase public acceptance of climate policy.

## Slide 4. Funding Match: Distinct Roles of ERDF and JTF
- ERDF: productivity, innovation, and infrastructure investment (building long-term growth engines).
- JTF: transition-shock mitigation (reskilling, worker mobility, local economic diversification).
- Principle: no overlap in spending (separate output indicators and implementation responsibility by package).

## Slide 5. Expected Results and Funding Request
- Result 1: reduced regional inequality by protecting transition-vulnerable groups.
- Result 2: accelerated climate-neutral transition in high-exposure territories.
- Request: support this evidence-based package, immediately implementable within the 2021-2027 framework.
