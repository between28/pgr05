# Place-based policy and the green transition

Work in groups of 3:
5-minute presentation to convince EU decision makers to fund your project

Your project needs to address regional inequality while at the same time contribute to achieving climate neutrality

And it needs to leverage resources from at least two Cohesion Funds: European Regional Development Fund, and Just Transition Fund.

# Place-based policy and the green transition
This lecture explores how place-based policy interacts with green transition policies. What are the territorial effects of actions trying to address climate change? Are winners and losers evenly spread across space, and to what extent does this intersect with policies addressing territorial economic imbalances? The lecture will be student-led, and you will have to work in groups to deliver a 5-minute verbal policy briefing.

Task
Imagine you are a civil servant working in a region of one of the EU Member States, preparing an evidence-based intervention to reduce regional inequality using the “European Cohesion Policy”. The audience for your outputs is a panel of decision-makers with limited time who are assessing competing interventions for funding (incidentally, they are PGR graduates).

Select ONE region that is categorised as “Less Developed” by the Cohesion Policy framework (see here which regions are eligible). Prepare a 5-minute verbal briefing of a maximum of 5 slides based on what your intervention is, why it should be funded, and how it will contribute to achieving climate neutrality while, at the same time, addressing regional inequality and ensuring a fair and just treatment to citizens most impacted by the transition. Your group will pitch your idea in front of the class, who will vote (anonymously) for the most innovative one. The winners will receive a prestigious and unique prize, which may consist of a lollipop or a bag of crisps.

In the current EU programming period 2021-27, the EU Cohesion Policy aims to combine regional development objectives with the overarching goal of achieving a green and just transition (cf. the European Green Deal). The EU Cohesion Policy is delivered through four main funds. In your proposal, you need to leverage resources from at least two funds, namely the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Just Transition Fund (JTF).
