It is also planned to expand the depot with parking spaces for buses and rebuild the exit from ul. The Deaf (Jn. 2/3, zone 1 – Abramowice) per sec. 79, division 9 – Tenth II in Lublin (outside the project). As part of the investment, it is planned to build an administrative building – where rooms such as: cloakrooms, showers, utility room, social room, toilet, car wash with car wash technical room, vehicle inspection hall. The following installations will be carried out in the building: • Hot and cold water • Heating and air conditioning • Mechanical ventilation • Sanitary sewerage • Rain sewerage • Electrical • Refrigeration • Compressed air There will be a change in the course of the external networks of the installation: water and sewage, gas (outside the project). Water supply by converting the water supply connection dn 50 PE to a connection with a diameter of dn 90 PE (water supply connection and rainwater drainage outside the project). Lighthouses illuminating the depot square will be built. In addition, it is planned to make acoustic fences that will reduce the possibility of impact of the investment on the neighboring buildings in terms of sound emission. In addition, the project will purchase 20 12 m zero-emission trolleybuses with an additional drive powered by batteries. In order to ensure proper service and operation of the delivered Trolleybuses, the Contractor shall train at the seat or place indicated by the Ordering Party 40 drivers indicated by the Ordering Party in the field of driving rules and 20 employees of technical facilities in the field of periodic maintenance and repair of Trolleybuses, including 5 employees of technical facilities in the field enabling specialist repairs along with assigning access codes to diagnostic software. The project also includes educational activities promoting the use of low-emission public transport. 1. Conducting a total of 30 educational meetings (1h each) with a zero-emission bus/trolleybus ride for preschool and school children. 2. Presentation of the purchased trolleybuses to a wider audience during the Communication Picnic organized as part of the annual celebrations of the European Mobility Week The purchased rolling stock will be stationed at the Bus Depot at ul. A. Grygowa 56 in Lublin. The city of Lublin strives for zero-emission mobility and the use of renewable energy sources for transport as much as possible. As part of the project, lighting installations with LED luminaires are planned. The LED lighting installation used as part of the project brings many environmental benefits compared to traditional light sources. This translates into savings in energy consumption. LEDs do not contain mercury, which occurs e.g. in fluorescent lamps and sodium lamps, which eliminates the risk of environmental contamination during their disposal. Traditional light bulbs convert a large part of energy into heat, while LEDs emit much less heat, which reduces the impact on the climate in enclosed spaces.",

The project will improve the connection to the TEN-T network (S17, S19-Via Carpatia), the border crossing points in Dorohusk (UA) and Hrebenne (UA) and the network of national (79, 9) and provincial roads. The implementation of the project will improve the quality of transport connection with Radom, including the Warsaw-Radom Airport. It will establish a link with the public transport subsystem. It will improve access to logistics centres in Radom and Leipzig districts. This project: - co-creates comprehensive area solutions - the project is the final element filling the last gap in the existing infrastructure in a given area (the last stage of expansion/reconstruction of the entire 93 km of the DW 747 route), - directly uses the products or results of other projects in the field of road infrastructure expansion (extension of DW 747 on the section Lipsko - Lublin bypass with the bridge over the Vistula), - performs together with other complementary projects the same function, thanks to which the capabilities of the existing infrastructure are fully used, - together with other projects it is used by the same users. The project aims to ensure faster and safer connections between central centres and other areas of the voivodship, better access to the network of national roads, regional economic centres, existing and planned industrial and service facilities and investment areas. The road in question will constitute a public infrastructure for the use of which users will not be charged. There will be no discriminatory factors.",

Part of the scope of the project has been implemented or is in the process of being implemented. The project will create cycle paths and pavements that will complement the missing elements of the already existing bicycle and pedestrian road system in the city and build/rebuild public transport infrastructure to better integrate with, inter alia, walking and cycling and adapt to the needs of people with special needs. The implementation of the investment concerns infrastructure for non-motorized traffic and the elimination of obstacles and threats in pedestrian and bicycle traffic and the creation of possibly collision-free, continuous and safe pedestrian and bicycle routes. The beneficiary has approved architectural and construction documentation, a feasibility study and permits for the implementation of the investment. Contractors for construction works and information, promotion and education activities have been/will be selected as a result of public procurement procedures. The need to implement projects stems from the need to increase the broadly understood attractiveness of the public transport system and related to individual means of transport in Lublin and LOM through its further expansion. Implementation of the activities planned in the project will contribute to increasing the use and improvement of infrastructure for non-motorized traffic and public transport infrastructure in the city of Lublin and LOM. New cycle paths, walking and cycling routes and pavements in connection with public transport, whose services are used by residents of the entire LOM (and are provided, on the basis of appropriate agreements, in ten municipalities outside the city of Lublin) will contribute to the wider use of more efficient public transport and non-motorized individual transport. The implementation of the investment will reduce individual motorized traffic, and consequently promote and increase pedestrian and bicycle traffic in city centers and their functional areas, and will contribute to the reduction of exhaust emissions and thus improve air quality and the natural environment in the city and LOM. The project is also a response to residents' expectations regarding the development of broadly understood public transport and individual forms of urban mobility and also fits into the broader concept of using the Lublin City Bike as another urban means of transport.",

The beginning of the expansion is in km approx. 5+533 in Zaborów and the end in km approx. 8+622 in Zaborów. In addition, it is planned to replace the wear surface on the existing bridge over the Wisłok River from approx. 5+416 to km approx. 5+533. The scope of the project includes, among others: - extension of the section of provincial road No 988 with a length of 3,089 km to the following parameters: road class G, load capacity: 115 kN/axle, roadway with a width of 7.0m (2x3.5) with bitumen and aggregate sides, - extension of intersections with other public roads (municipal and district), - reconstruction of the viaduct over railway line No 106 Rzeszów Główny - Jasło, - construction of 7 small bridges, - modernisation of the bridge over the Wisłok River, - construction/reconstruction of pedestrian walkways, - reconstruction/construction of bus bays, - extension of the drainage system, including, among others: construction and reconstruction of grassy open ditches, construction of covered ditches (rain sewerage), reconstruction/extension of culverts, - reconstruction/construction of individual and public exits and entries/exits to the road lane for maintenance purposes - construction of an additional provincial roadway for connecting plots, - construction/reconstruction of road lighting, - construction of a technological channel, - protection of a landslide, - construction of acoustic protection devices - acoustic screens, quiet surface, - reconstruction of collisions and protection of existing land-weapon networks (networks: teletechnical, electricity, gas pipeline, water supply, sanitary sewerage). - execution of vertical and horizontal markings and road safety components. The main objective of the project is to develop and improve sustainable, climate-resilient, intelligent and intermodal mobility at national, regional and local level, including improving access to TEN-T and cross-border mobility. The direct objective of the project is to develop the infrastructure of provincial roads and improve transport links in the region, including in mountain areas. The section of road 988 in question is in poor technical condition, with permanent visco-plastic and structural deformations, cracks, defects in binders and grains in the surface, patches, bumps, mesh cracks, broken edges, numerous irregularities in the cross-section and longitudinal section and inflated groundsides. This, in conjunction with the very high volume of traffic occurring on the road in question, causes great difficulties, slowdowns and lack of traffic flow, as well as negatively affects safety. The implementation of the Project will improve the quality of transport infrastructure and optimise connections with the Małopolskie Voivodship from the direction of Gorlice to the S19 expressway in Babica and south to Barwinek and north towards Lublin. It will also lead to: improving the links between the regional road network of the voivodship and the national road network and the trans-European transport network TEN-T, improving the internal and external accessibility of the district of Strzyżów and surrounding towns, improving the social and economic cohesion of the Rzeszów Functional Area and increasing the prospects for its development, as well as improving the comfort and safety of travel DW 988. The implementation will reduce the negative impact of transport on the environment and living conditions of residents by reducing the impact of noise and exhaust gases and reducing the inconvenience associated with the congestion of the transport system. The investment will ensure a smooth connection of the local road system with the roads of the higher government and at the same time will affect the spatial and economic development of the surrounding area. A measurable effect after the completion of the investment will be a reduction in travel time, a reduction in the number of accidents and a reduction in traffic nuisance for the surrounding areas.",

    "description": "The project implements the type specified in the SZOP under Measure 9.2, project type 1: Improving the situation on the labour market of working poor and people employed on short-term contracts, civil law. The aim of the project is to improve the situation on the labour market of 80 UP (40K and 40M) working poor and people employed on short-term contracts, civil law, living in the area of 5 counties located in the south-eastern part of the Lubelskie Voivodeship, i.e.: Chełmski, Krasnostawski, Hrubieszowski, Zamość and Tomaszów. The support offered under the project will be individualised and tailored to the diagnosed needs of 80 project participants (POs) on the basis of the Individual Action Plan (IPD) in order to increase access to stable employment and opportunities to improve skills and competences/skills. The project will focus on people in a difficult situation on the labour market, i.e. people with disabilities, people aged 55+, young people (aged 18-29), people of foreign origin. The gender parity was determined on the basis of the participation of women and men in the labour market in the area covered by the project. As part of the project, comprehensive support is planned in the form of: - career (individual) counselling - psychological counselling - legal counselling - vocational training tailored to the expectations and capabilities of the UP and the labour market, the so-called \"Public Employment Law\" (PPE) \"tailor-made\", - job placement - career coaching for 40% of UP - training on adapting socio-occupational life to ecological requirements related to the circular economy and the ambition of zero pollution. The above forms of support offered by UP will solve many problems by: creating/improving IPD to implement an individual development path, breaking down psychological and social barriers, barriers resulting from ignorance of the law, acquiring/completing qualifications/competences allowing to stay on the labour market under better working conditions and wages, people in a vulnerable situation will receive additional support from a career coach, which will help to break down barriers to acquiring new qualifications. In addition, each of the UP will be able to participate and possibly gain competences in the field of the green economy, which will undoubtedly strengthen their position on the labour market. PARTICULARS TO BE RESULATED: - A minimum of 80% of UP, i.e. a minimum of 64 persons, will obtain a certificate/occupational qualification, which is an important result in terms of improving UP's situation on the labour market. - Training in the green economy in social and professional life will result in the acquisition of competences by at least 64 people, i.e. 80% of UP. --- Taking up education/training after the end of participation in the project. WN assumes this indicator at least at the level of 3 people (2K and 1M), because at the stage of applying for project co-financing, it is difficult to predict how many PAs will be affected by this situation. The project is consistent with the horizontal policies of the European Union, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including in particular the principle of equal opportunities and non-discrimination, accessibility for persons with disabilities, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well as the principle of sustainable development, the provisions of national and EU law, the SZOP of the FEL 2021-2027 programme, and also fits into the objectives set out in the Municipal Revitalisation Plans in the area of implementation of the P.",

The project assumes type 1 implementations for Measure 9.2 Improving the labour market situation of working poor and people employed on short-term, civil law contracts and is compatible and will contribute to the achievement of specific objective 4(a) (ESF+) of Priority IX and the objective of Measure 9.2 which is to improve access to employment and activation measures for all jobseekers, in particular young people, especially through the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged groups on the labour market, as well as for inactive people, and by promoting self-employment and the social economy by achieving results: - the qualifications will be acquired by at least 70% of the participants of the trainings implemented under the project - i.e. 42 pers. - all OPs will be included in the scope of activities supporting the green transition in order to adapt the skills/competences of project participants to the new environmental requirements related to the circular economy and the zero pollution ambition. Justification for implementation: Restructuring and modernization of various industries caused by the deepening economic crisis. - COVID-19, the ongoing war, and the associated mass layoffs have resulted in an increase in the unemployment rate, an increase in the employment of fixed-term/civil-law contracts, which contributes to the deterioration of the financial situation, stabilisation, exclusion. The problem in the Lubelskie Voivodship is the worsening situation on the labour market caused by the shortage of, among others, work in shortage occupations (Bar. profession), the lack of stabilization of employees employed on the basis of short-term civil law contracts and the need to change their current profession and take up employment. In this regard, the importance of the development of border infrastructure (border crossing points facilitating border traffic and increasing transit capacity) should be stressed as an indirect factor supporting the development of the transp. industry and deficit occupations. In view of the changing labour market, it is necessary to intervene in the adaptation of qualifications to the changes taking place in the labour market. The project will focus on providing support in the form of training, which will improve the situation of the PA on the labour market.",

According to the GPR, there are numerous negative social phenomena in the area of Podzamcze, such as: poverty, domestic violence or other special family needs, e.g. disability. The area of Błonia, despite its attractive location in the city center, is not fully used and on a daily basis remains a bit off the beaten track of the city's social and tourist life. The Błonia area is modestly equipped and needs to be renovated, but it has a great potential that can positively affect the quality of life of residents and the interest of tourists. As part of the project, it is planned to adapt the infrastructure to the different needs of users, plant and care for greenery and promote heritage, which refers to sustainable development. The Błonia area will be organized and adapted to standards in the field of: climate resilience, e.g.: use of good quality materials, planting greenery, adapted to urban conditions and functional and usable, e.g.: construction of an inclusive playground, replacement of track surfaces, construction of monitoring. The infrastructure is designed to encourage children, adults and the elderly to spend time outdoors by creating a passive and active recreation zone. It is planned to use solutions inspired by nature and save resources, e.g.: elements of the playground will be made of wood, as part of the replacement of lighting, energy-saving led lamps have been designed. As a result of the project, the Błonia area will offer not only a modern and tailored to various needs place for relaxation and daily integration, but also the opportunity to participate in seasonal cultural and educational events during the project's durability period. Revitalization of Błonia near the Castle along with complementary projects in the field of strengthening social ties will make this area gain new social and functional values, which will also translate into a greater number of visits. The result of the actions taken will be, among others, improving the quality of life of the local community and equalizing development disparities within the city.

    "title": "Purchase of zero-emission, electricity-powered rolling stock for passenger transport in the Podkarpackie Voivodeship",
    "description": "The aim of the project is to develop and improve sustainable transport at regional and local level, including: - improving the quality of services provided in public transport, - improving the accessibility of means of rail transport for people with disabilities - reducing the negative impact on the environment by adapting the impact of rail on the environment to the level required by regulations - reducing certain nuisances related to railway infrastructure, e.g. noise - improving communication links - increasing the cohesion of the region's transport system - increasing the reliability of rail transport - improving the accessibility of peripheral regions to rail connections with a constant increase in the number of inhabitants - ensuring an efficient, fast and comfortable way of movement. The project includes the delivery of: a) 3 new four-section electric rail vehicles with training on operation and maintenance b) 3 new five-section electric rail vehicles with training on operation and maintenance. PROBLEMS AND NEEDS SUPPORTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT Regional passenger rail transport in the Podkarpackie voivodship has been losing its importance in favour of road transport since 1990. This is conditioned, among others, by the different transport accessibility of the village to existing railway lines and competition in the form of bus transport. A negative phenomenon in the rail transport system is the lack of stability, continuity in the timetable of trains and poor transport offer, which further discourages potential passengers from this mode of transport. In some relationships, it is noted that vehicles are no longer comfortable and safe enough due to their capacity limitations. In particular, the problem concerns connections on line 91. The project will have a direct impact on solving the problems of the Applicant and the Operator in the field of passenger rail transport. Indirectly, it will affect the inhabitants of the voivodship and other people moving through its territory, various institutions, economic entities (including enterprises) and non-governmental organizations that use public (rail) transport in their activities. For this group of beneficiaries, a number of problems can be identified. Firstly, the passenger transport services provided in the province are characterised by a relatively average level of transport accessibility. This state of affairs mainly consists of the Operator's inefficient and outdated rolling stock, through which passenger transport is carried out in the province. This rolling stock was produced in the 1970s and 1980s. 20th century and does not have air conditioning and ticket machines. This is due to inadequate adaptation of public transport to the reported needs and too long journey times. Thus, tourists and residents of the voivodeship have problems with efficient and comfortable movement on its territory. The result is a low level of competitiveness and unfavourable perception of rail transport in the province. The transport needs of the inhabitants of the Podkarpackie voivodship result not only from the current needs of everyday life of the inhabitants (i.e. the need to commute to workplaces, schools, etc.), but also from the recreational, leisure and tourist function performed by the voivodship. There is therefore a need to provide residents and tourists with comfortable access to both agglomerations and rural areas. In addition to the needs in terms of directions of travel by rail, there are growing needs among passengers in terms of travel comfort, safety or accessibility of rolling stock for all people, including people with special needs. The justification for the need to implement the project is described in detail in points 1.1 and 1.2 of the study.",

    "description": "One of the basic challenges in the project’s area of impact is an underdeveloped road infrastructure and insufficient quantity and low quality of transportation connections. The condition of technical infrastructure hinders contacts and cross-border traffic, and as a result reduces the attractiveness of the region for investors and impedes development processes. Fulfilment of this process is a response to the indicated problems. Its main purpose is supporting cross-border development processes in the borderland of Poland and Ukraine through an increase of transport accessibility of the region and an improvement of the road infrastructure. Achieving the indicated target will be possible by increasing technical parameters of a 6.615 km section of national road no. 885 Przemyśl – Hermanowice – state boarder, as well as an increase of communication accessibility for the designed border crossing Malhowice-Niżankowice. The development of the project will result in a 10% passage time decrease. It will also result in an increase of accessibility of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship for Western Ukraine. An effect of the development will be a creation of a new road connection between the countries, an alternative for the existing Przemyśl-Medyka-Lviv connection. It will result in an increase of international traffic mobility, both borderland and transit. It will have an influence on forming new foundations for Polish-Ukrainian cooperation, the development of tourism and trade. This project will be developed in a close partnership between the Podkarpackie Regional Road Management and Lviv Regional State Administration. Due to engagement of both sides in the project, an exchange of mutual practices, know-how and knowledge will be possible. It will affect a more effective implementation of the project and acquiring information and experiences which will be useful in the implementation of consecutive investments, both by the Polish and Ukrainian.",

    "description": "The project consists of the introduction of an ecological, maintenance-free aeration system based on the technology of small-size wind turbines. The product is directed mainly to fish pond owners. This solution makes it possible to reduce the mortality of fish due to the effect of the so-called phantom (low oxygen level in water), which on average in the winter is responsible for the death of 23.9 % of farms. In the case of large farms, this translates into huge losses, which causes breeders to invest in conventional aeration technologies (electrical or combustion systems). However, their maintenance can be problematic and costly. Often, service costs are so high that customers are interested in using an alternative solution over time. The technological advantage of the product is mainly due to the fact that it is independent of conventional energy sources. It is a maintenance-free system that, unlike standard solutions, does not require interference with its operation. It is also a technologically advanced product that has new solutions to ensure safety and maximise efficiency. The planned product is innovative at least at national level and beyond national level (sources: recommendation of the KPT, verification in databases: Esp@cenet, Depatisnet, Patentscope, FO3D9/1). In addition, the product has development potential, it is possible to extend its use in other industries: transport of water and gases; desalination of sea water; supplying industrial plants with compressed air, etc. Basic actions/resources to implement the project: 1.Creation of machine park 2.Preparation of product sales network 3.Producing new products from the industry of ecological systems for industrial and agricultural applications, e.g. systems for accumulation of wind energy in the form of compressed air.

    "title": "Purchase of rescue cars, trailers and drones for the purpose of conducting rescue operations by the Regional Group of the Mountain Voluntary Rescue Group Bieszczadzka Group",
    "description": "The project includes the task of equipping the rescue system unit with high-quality equipment to ensure the protection of health and human life, which in the planning documents of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship (WP) is one of the directions of action to counteract, minimize and remove threats. The subject of the project is the purchase of two rescue cars, a trailer and drones for the purpose of conducting rescue operations by the Bieszczady Group GOPR - an entity that has obtained the consent of the minister competent for internal affairs for the implementation of mountain rescue Decision No 40/2013 of 30.12.2013 and has an entry in the register of units cooperating with the State Medical Rescue system. According to Annex 14 to this proposal, poor equipment in operational cars and unmanned aerial vehicles, in particular for mountain rescue activities, is a significant barrier to the development of a safety system in the HR. The current state of equipment of the group with operational technical means and means of transport achieved through many years of efforts and obtaining funds from many sources does not sufficiently cover the actual demand resulting from the implementation of the tasks imposed by the regulations. Despite the fact that the group is regularly equipped with the necessary equipment, it is still equipped with outdated vehicles in the group of off-road vehicles, as well as four-wheel vehicles or unmanned aerial vehicles. The Bieszczadzka Group has only one vehicle adapted to the safe transport of people injured in accidents. Average age of the unit’s vehicles (including vehicles of the type: Quad) is 9 years old. The intensity of use and the use of vehicles and equipment in extreme conditions, with a very high risk, causes that their consumption is much higher than under normal conditions of use. Therefore, most of the equipment wears out much faster, without reaching the assumed operating periods. As a result of the insufficient number of newly purchased vehicles or drones, there is no full replacement, especially those intended for withdrawal. This reduces the efficiency of the equipment and increases the expenditure of funds for their further maintenance in technical efficiency and rescue readiness. Poor equipment of the unit responsible for undertaking mountain rescue activities reduces the broadly rumored level of safety, i.e. the safety of people staying in the mountains, including residents of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship, and safety in terms of management conditions. As a result, the competitiveness of the voivodeship is reduced, and the living conditions of residents are not satisfactory. Insufficient protection of the inhabitants of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship in terms of the potential to undertake, among others, mountain rescue activities, is a current problem that results from: a significant risk associated with the occurrence of events resulting in human actions or forces of nature, poor equipment of the GOPR of the Bieszczady Group, worn-out operating cars and technical equipment (drones), a shortage of cars adapted to the safe transport of injured persons. This situation results in: low level of security in terms of the above-mentioned risks. Meeting the needs of local communities and tourists resting here, in terms of improving the rescue system, civil protection and the sense of security among citizens, which, based on modernized technical facilities, which will be used mainly for mountain rescue, will increase the effectiveness of response to existing threats and was considered crucial, and strongly dependent on the implementation of the proposed project. The aim of the project is to improve the state of preparation of the Regional Group of the GOPR to take rescue actions in situations of threats resulting from the occurrence of events that result in human actions or forces of nature.",

    "description": "The aim of the project is to increase the level of social and professional activation of 80 participants of WTZ Wojnicy w Dołubowie and WTZ Kolektyw w Raciborach Starych (39K and 41M) in the period 01/04/2025 – 31/03/2027. Specific objectives: a) Increasing the level of social activation of OCT participants b) Increasing the level of professional activation of OCT participants c) Increasing the chances on the labour market of OCT participants. For over 15 years we have been working in the villages (Siemiatic and high school districts), leading WTZ Collective and Warriors. In the area of our activities, there is practically no support for people with disabilities outside the OTSC (no access to specialists, no offer of leisure time for people with disabilities), there are no vacancies on the protected labour market and there is a low level of cooperation between reintegration entities and employers on the open labour market. Another barrier is the minimum level or rather the lack of public transport (we have to get everywhere by rented transport). Participants of our WTZów are a group of inhabitants of the Podlaskie voivodship diverse in terms of age, opportunities, degree of disability. They share a low level of social and professional competence and a low level of ability to cope with anxiety and uncertainty. They require reinforcement in terms of motivation to take action, faith in their abilities and a sense of being needed and important. They need support in expressing their opinions and shaping habits of taking care of their health. 87% of the participants of both WTZs are residents of villages excluded from access to high culture. The solution to the above-mentioned problems will be to provide comprehensive support to 80 project participants, which will be provided to them for a period of max. 23 months, based on a reintegration path, created individually for each person expressed in the form of IPASZ (Individual Social and Occupational Activity Plan). The basis of IPASZ will be the diagnosis of the problem situation of project participants, their resources, potential, predispositions and needs. IPASZ will be a living document that will be evaluated in accordance with the ongoing support provided to participants in the project. As part of the project, activities will be carried out such as: social contact contracts, individual and group psychological counselling (660h) and professional counselling (560h), social skills training (160h), health education classes (108 workshops and 80h consultations) and physical improvement (324h), trips to high culture places for 80 people, study visits up to 2 ZAZs for 80 people, professional training (barista's helper, waiter and professional cleaning) for 60 people, internal practices in mini cafes for 80 people, external practices in accordance with the profile of vocational training for 40 people, consultations with a specialist for participants requiring support under alternative forms of communication, permanent support of the work coach. Thanks to the project activities, participants of WTZ will be assigned a realistic path of transition to ZAZ or to the open labour market in accordance with our local conditions. The results of the project will be: - increase in social activation of OCT participants by reducing mental barriers and strengthening social competences - increase in professional activation of pupils. OTSC thanks to the organization of professional support, training and apprenticeships - an increase in opportunities on the student's labour market. The effect of the actions will be to eliminate stereotypes of OZN as a passive person, a recipient of aid, unable to work, eliminating social and professional exclusion of OZN especially from rural areas, building a network of economic entities supporting the professional activation of OZN Collectives and Warriors participants on the open labour market. The implementation of the activities will be based on the Standards of functioning of WTZów, in which the WTZ Collective and Warriors took part in the pilot.",

    "description": "Wiślan Bike Route is a route from the group of 8 main routes of Małopolska, part of the integrated network of cycle routes of Małopolska Voivodeship. It runs through the most attractive areas of the Vistula valley. The length of the entire route is about 220 km, while the project covers section I of the Vistula Bicycle Route with a length of about 90.8 km located in central and eastern Małopolska. The WTR is located along the river Vistula from the village of Drwinia (Niepołomice) to Szczucin commune. The width of the route on the shaft is 2.5 m. It is allowed to narrow the width of the road in places where the geometry of the shaft does not allow the construction of a bicycle road with a width of 2.5 m. This cycle route mostly uses the Vistula river shafts as an ecological transport link without motor traffic, thus ensuring healthy recreation in a clean environment. Small inclinations (up to 6 % and Vp min 30 km/h) and level differences make it pleasant and easy for ordinary cyclists as well as for families with children, as well as cyclists with trailers or purses. As part of this project, 90.8 km of bicycle route is planned. The entire length of the route marking is planned in accordance with the guidelines of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices and their conditions on roads and in accordance with the Regulation of Ministers of Infrastructure and Internal Affairs and Administration on road signs and signals and with the adopted logo of Wiślana Bicycle Route.

    "title": "Supporting the energy transition in Eastern Wielkopolska",
    "description": "The aim of the project is to prepare a comprehensive educational offer for local administration and key stakeholders in the context of the energy transformation of Eastern Wielkopolska. The objective will be achieved during the period: 1September 2024 – 31 August 2026 by developing substantive housing, i.e. teaching materials taking into account regional specialisations for market qualifications diagnosed in the application, in particular those operating in the Integrated Qualifications Register, and then testing and implementing the created educational model into practice. Based on the diagnosis*, it was decided to direct support for the group of 200os. - officials and employees of NGOs from the area of Eastern Wielkopolska. It is an area heavily dependent on coal and the mining industry. Due to the ongoing energy transition in Europe and Poland, jobs in mining and related sectors are to be finally extinguished in this region by 2049. This is linked to a process of massive societal change at many levels: education, labour market, social. The key staff to effectively conduct the process are stakeholders from the broadly understood public sector, including: public administration, employees of local government units and their organisational units (e.g. labour offices, organisational units, social assistance units, investment units), as well as employees of the so-called Social Security Offices, 3 sector, as animators and responsible for local development and at the same time supporting groups at risk of poverty and social exclusion. The demand for competences and qualifications in the project is in line with the provisions of the Territorial Just Transition Plan (TPST) for Eastern Wielkopolska (WW), under which various activities are to be initiated to activate and support the EU regions most affected by the negative phenomena of the energy transition. One of the objectives of TPST is to: \"...support for the upskilling and reskilling and skills development of adults in directions consistent with Smart Specialisations (IS) and the needs of a zero-emission, resource-efficient and digital economy...\". According to IS, the most promising sectors in Eastern Wielkopolska are: Tourism and logistics. The qualifications selected in the project result from the diagnosis carried out and correspond to the development needs of the region in the above-mentioned scope. The competency gap diagnosed concerns in particular skills in the area of: sustainable management, use of ICT tools supporting the customer service process; effective communication; effectively navigate the network, taking into account security and data protection elements, the use of AI tools in everyday work. Our project responds to the diagnosed needs in the area of effective implementation of changes in connection with the long-term transformation process, which is just beginning in Poland and the Wielkopolska region, which is finally to be completed in Eastern Wielkopolska in 2040. The WSKM is based in the Energy Transition area and works for an equal and fair coal phase-out process. The partnership with the Turkish Chamber of Commerce will ensure the development of solutions supporting the logistics and tourism sector, which has great potential for the development of the region. The Chamber brings together several dozen companies from the region from the transport, forwarding, logistics, tourism, gastronomy and hospitality sectors. Therefore, the training offer of staff implementing the transition developed in the project will be used for at least several years after the end of the project, ensuring the sustainability of the planned results. *Diagnosis (desk research) based on: -TPST for Eastern Wielkopolska 2022 Regional Innovation Strategy for Wielkopolska 2030 - Smart Specializations for Wielkopolska. Links to the documents confirming the diagnosis of the need for qualifications can be found in the section \"Potential for implementation\".",

The specific objective is to enable regions and people to mitigate the social, employment, economic and environmental impacts of the transition towards the Union’s 2030 targets for energy and climate and towards a climate-neutral economy of the Union by 2050 based on the Paris Agreement (FST). The proposed lines of action are: grant support for investments in SMEs, grant support for investments in SMEs contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonisation, the implementation of circular economy solutions, reducing the energy intensity of processes and services, investments in R&D activities and the implementation of innovations increasing the potential of Lower Silesian smart specialisations. - Territorial Just Transition Plan for the Lower Silesian Voivodeship 2021-2030 - Wałbrzych Subregion: the specific economic objective is economic activation and strengthening competitiveness by exploiting the endogenous potential of the sub-region in a way that ensures the achievement of the objectives of low emission reduction and decarbonisation. This goal assumes the activation of the economic sector in the area of green, competitive technologies, opens an opportunity for the development of innovation and diversification of economic activity and the creation of additional jobs with significant added value in industries already present in the subregion. For the economic purpose, activities of changes in products, processes that fit into the principles of circularity will be implemented. This project fits perfectly into the above assumptions. It includes the construction of a completely new production hall and its comprehensive equipment with production machines, cooling and central feed systems, as well as modern storage racks with system trolleys. The plant will be equipped with specialized production management software. The implementation of the investment will contribute to the dynamic development of the company operating for years in the Wałbrzych Subregion (in Kłodzko). The planned actions will allow the introduction of an innovative product resulting from R&D works, increasing the volume of existing production at such a plant organization, in order to further reduce energy consumption in production and reduce the amount of waste and pollution generated. The process innovation used will allow for a significant improvement in the management of the raw material and will contribute to the overall change of the production process in the plant. The implementation of the project will additionally require the employment of new people to operate machines in specialized positions. Promotion of the project will take place by installing an appropriate information board and creating a special tab on the Company's website.",

    "description": "The aim of the project is to prepare a comprehensive educational offer for local administration and key stakeholders in the context of the energy transformation of Western Małopolska. The objective will be achieved during the period: 1.IX.2024 – 31.VIII.2026r. by developing substantive enclosures, i.e. dashboard materials taking into account regional specialisations for qualifications selected at the diagnosis stage, in particular those operating in the Integrated Qualifications Register, and then testing and implementing the created model into practice. Based on the diagnosis*, it was decided to direct support for the group of 200os. - officials and employees of NGOs from the area of Western Małopolska. It is an area heavily dependent on coal and the mining industry. Due to the ongoing energy transition in Europe and Poland, jobs in mining and related sectors are to be finally extinguished in this region by 2049. This is linked to a process of massive societal change at many levels: education, labour market, social. The key staff to effectively conduct the process are stakeholders from the broadly understood public sector, including: public administration, employees of local government units and their organisational units (e.g. labour offices, organisational units, social assistance units, investment units), as well as employees of the so-called Social Security Offices, 3 sector, as animators and responsible for local development and at the same time supporting groups at risk of poverty and social exclusion. The demand for competences and qualifications in the project is in line with the provisions of the Territorial Just Transition Plan (TPST) for Western Małopolska (MZ), under which various activities are to be initiated to activate and support the EU regions most affected by the negative phenomena of the energy transition. One of the objectives of TPST is to: ...increasing the competences of local administration to prepare for participation in the energy transition and initiatives on climate neutrality, sustainable consumption and the circular economy... One of the most promising sectors in W. Małopolska is the creative industries and leisure time understood as production, production, exhibition, sale and production of copyrighted goods, cultural activities and the tourism industry. The qualifications selected in the project result from the diagnosis carried out and correspond to the development needs of the region in the above-mentioned scope. The competency gap diagnosed concerns in particular skills in the area of: sustainable management, use of ICT tools supporting the customer service process; effective communication; prof. service of contractors; using new technologies, including AI. Our project responds to the diagnosed needs in the area of effective implementation of changes in connection with the long-term, and just starting transformation process, which is finally to be completed in 2049. The university is based in Małopolska, borders with the MZ area and works for the development of the community-gosp. The partnership with the Malopolska Tourism Organization, org. bringing together several hundred employers from the region (companies, institutions, NGOs) will ensure the development of solutions supporting the tourism sector, which has great potential for development. Lesser Poland was visited by 10 million tourists, of which 2.65 million were foreign), a large part of which attracts the richness of the region's cultural heritage. Therefore, the developed training offer for staff implementing the transition will be used for at least several years after the end, ensuring the sustainability of the results. *Diagnosis (desk research) based on: -TPST for Western Małopolska 2022 Regional Innovation Strategy WM 2030; -Intelligent Specializations for Małopolska -WUP Kraków \"Adult Learning 2021\".
