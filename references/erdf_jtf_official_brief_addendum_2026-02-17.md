# ERDF/JTF Brief Addendum (Q&A Update, 17 Feb 2026)

Update note:
- Expanded casebook + concrete Lubelskie project package (with war-impact integration) is in:
  - `references/lubelskie_casebook_project_proposal_2026-02-17.md`
- Map/statistics evidence pack is in:
  - `references/lubelskie_strong_evidence_pack_2026-02-17.md`

## 1) Slide-4 framing update: the "current-system limit" is not only about missing JTF
Your framing is correct. For Lubelskie, the limit is two-layered:
- `Funding-architecture limit`: in the currently published Lubelskie call schedule, there is no JTF line.
- `Policy-response limit`: even with ERDF/ESF+ windows, it is hard to fully address all just-transition pain points at once (worker transition, distributional fairness, local industrial diversification) without a dedicated just-transition envelope.

Use this sentence in your slide:
- `Current architecture can fund important decarbonisation and service upgrades, but it cannot fully internalise the social and labour-transition risks we identified; this is why a staged ERDF-first, JTF-ready pathway is needed.`

---

## 2) What ESF+ is (official)
ESF+ is the EU's main people-focused cohesion instrument.
- Official definition: ESF+ is the EU's main instrument for investing in people.
- Budget: EUR 142.7 billion for 2021-2027.
- Policy scope: employment, social inclusion, education, and skills.
- Management mode: mostly managed by Member States (shared-management logic with Commission supervision).

Practical meaning for your project:
- ERDF = hard assets/infrastructure/business transition.
- ESF+ = people-side transition (reskilling, inclusion, labour market access).
- JTF = place-specific just-transition package for designated affected territories.

---

## 3) Are non-EU funds acceptable in this assignment?
`As complement: yes.`  
`As substitute for ERDF+JTF: no.`

Your local guideline (`presentation_5min/pt_guideline.md`) says funding design must combine at least ERDF and JTF.  
So non-EU funding can be shown only as co-financing/leverage, not as replacement of ERDF/JTF in the core logic.

---

## 4) Lubelskie vs Lublin
- `Lubelskie` = a voivodeship (regional unit, NUTS2: PL81 in EU classification context).
- `Lublin` = one city, and the capital city of Lubelskie.

So your presentation unit is the region (Lubelskie), not only the city of Lublin.

---

## 5) Is "2026 pilot -> 2028-2034 scale-up" a good presentation strategy?
Yes, this is one of the most defensible structures.
- Stage 1 (2026-2027): small/medium implementation + demonstration under currently accessible ERDF/ESF+ windows.
- Stage 2 (post-2027 round): scale-up through ERDF+JTF package once legal and territorial conditions are confirmed.

This shows implementation realism, not just concept design.

---

## 6) Can a 2026 project continue to 2029?
Generally yes, with conditions.
- CPR eligibility rule for the 2021-2027 period allows expenditure until 31 Dec 2029.
- But each call/grant agreement can impose tighter deadlines.
- Also, decommitment pressure exists in the period, so late execution increases risk.

Safe wording:
- `2026-start operations can continue into 2028-2029, provided call-level and grant-level deadlines are respected and all eligible expenditure is incurred by 31 Dec 2029.`

---

## 7) Why Lubelskie was not JTF-covered in 2021-2027 (official logic + inference)

### Official logic
- JTF is designed for territories most negatively affected by transition away from fossil-fuel/carbon-intensive structures.
- Regulation language highlights territories relying heavily on fossil fuels (coal, lignite, peat, oil shale) or greenhouse-gas-intensive industries.
- Member States must define affected territories through Territorial Just Transition Plans (TJTPs), at NUTS3 or parts of NUTS3.

### Poland 2021-2027 implementation signal
- Official Polish launch statement identifies JTF coverage in selected voivodeships (Silesia, Lower Silesia, Wielkopolska, Lodzkie, Malopolska), and Lubelskie is not listed.

### Inference (explicit)
- Therefore, in 2021-2027, Lubelskie was not designated in Poland's final JTF territorial package as a "most negatively affected" just-transition territory.

---

## 8) Are there useful reference cases from selected JTF regions?
Yes, but with a caveat.
- Fully mature ex-post evidence from 2021-2027 JTF is still limited in many places because implementation is ongoing.
- For robust benchmarking now, combine:
  - ongoing JTF policy envelopes and call structures;
  - earlier transition projects in those same territories.

Example with verifiable numbers (Silesian transition territory):
- `Revitalisation and Access to the Post-Industrial Heritage of Upper Silesia` (Poland, Silesian Voivodeship, JTP project fiche)
  - Total budget: about EUR 31.1 million
  - EU funding: about EUR 18.55 million (ERDF 2014-2020)
  - Duration: 84 months (Oct 2016 - Sep 2023)
This is not a JTF-labelled operation, but it is a concrete transition-region benchmark for integrated regeneration logic.

## 9) ERDF windows in Lubelskie (official harmonogram 11 Feb 2026): what each does and fit for your project

### A) SME and business transition
1. `FELU.02.04 Digitalisation of SMEs` (competitive, SME-focused, 2025-12-19 to 2026-02-27, EUR 10.0m)  
Fit: useful for SME productivity and digital transition pilots; timing is early.
2. `FELU.03.08 Circular economy in enterprises` (competitive, SME-focused, 2026-04-08 to 2026-05-29, EUR 6.0m)  
Fit: strong for resource efficiency/industrial transition pilots.

### B) Climate, energy, mobility (closest to your core storyline)
3. `FELU.03.02 Climate adaptation, flood/drought prevention` (competitive, JST+SME, 2026-03-02 to 2026-03-31, EUR 16.65m)  
Fit: climate resilience pillar.
4. `FELU.04.01 Energy efficiency in buildings` (competitive, mainly public/social entities, 2026-03-02 to 2026-03-31, EUR 9.45m)  
Fit: direct match for energy-burden reduction.
5. `FELU.05.01 Low-emission urban transport` (competitive, mostly public operators, 2026-04-27 to 2026-05-28, EUR 18.89m)  
Fit: high relevance for low-carbon mobility and access.

### C) Nature, social infrastructure, place-based urban package
6. `FELU.03.09 Biodiversity in protected areas` (competitive, JST-led, 2026-03-02 to 2026-03-31, EUR 4.72m)  
Fit: selective, if nature-based adaptation is part of your logic.
7. `FELU.03.10 Biodiversity outside protected areas` (competitive, JST-led, 2026-03-02 to 2026-03-31, EUR 1.42m)  
Fit: selective.
8. `FELU.07.06 Social and integration service infrastructure` (competitive, JST-led, 2026-06-08 to 2026-07-09, EUR 5.46m)  
Fit: strong for just-transition social safeguards.

### D) ZIT-only / non-competitive pathways (not open to everyone)
9. `FELU.04.03 Energy efficiency under ZIT` (non-competitive, ZIT, 2025-09-25 to 2026-02-27, EUR 35.22m)
10. `FELU.05.02 Low-emission transport under ZIT` (non-competitive, ZIT, 2025-09-25 to 2026-03-31, EUR 17.77m)
11. `FELU.07.05 Education infrastructure under ZIT` (non-competitive, ZIT, 2026-03-17 to 2026-03-27, EUR 0.57m)
12. `FELU.11.03 Cultural heritage in urban functional areas under ZIT` (non-competitive, ZIT, 2026-03-16 to 2026-03-31, EUR 7.32m)

### Can you apply to all windows?
Practically, no.
- Different eligibility rules by applicant type (SME vs JST/public entities).
- Several windows are ZIT-only and non-competitive.
- No double financing of the same cost item across windows.
- Administrative capacity and procurement timeline constraints.

Recommended short list for your pitch logic:
- `Core`: FELU.04.01 + FELU.05.01 + FELU.03.02
- `Add-on`: FELU.03.08 (SME transition) + FELU.07.06 (social fairness)

## 10) Expanded explanation for "confirmed vs unconfirmed" (2028-2034 round)

### Confirmed facts
1. The Commission presented the 2028-2034 MFF proposal on 16 July 2025.
2. Under EU Treaty rules, MFF adoption requires Council unanimity and European Parliament consent.

### Not yet confirmed
1. Final post-2027 cohesion regulations (legal text still not final in this note).
2. Final country/regional allocations.
3. Final map of JTF territorial eligibility, including whether Lubelskie will be covered.
4. Exact first-call calendar in the new round.

### Safe speaking template (recommended)
- `Fact`: "The Commission has tabled the 2028-2034 MFF proposal."
- `Fact`: "Final legal adoption and allocations are still pending EU legislative agreement."
- `Assumption`: "Our scenario assumes Lubelskie can access a relevant ERDF/JTF window from the first feasible post-adoption calls."
- `Risk control`: "If JTF eligibility is delayed/excluded, Stage-1 ERDF/ESF+ package remains independently valuable."

---

## 11) On your point about budget design from external cases
Agreed. The EUR 60-90m scenario should be stress-tested with real comparators before final lock.

Minimum evidence package for your final budget design:
1. At least 3 comparator projects from transition regions (cost structure + delivery period + outcomes).
2. One comparator each for energy retrofit, low-carbon mobility, and labour/social transition support.
3. Explicit conversion from comparator unit costs into Lubelskie scale assumptions.
